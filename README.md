# RPiOpenBox

This is a better OpenBox configuration (OpenBox is the default window manager that comes with LXDE desktop environment, as used by Raspbian, Lubuntu, etc.)

    mv $HOME/.config/openbox/lxde-pi-rc.xml $HOME/.config/openbox/lxde-pi-rc.old
    cp lxde-pi-rc.xml $HOME/.config/openbox/

Look at diff.xml to see what I did

.for_reference_only is for refernce only from another LXDE desktop I had
